# Privacy-Preserving Corporate Governance - Video Dialogue Script

## Complete Voiceover Transcript

Welcome to Privacy-Preserving Corporate Governance, a breakthrough FHEVM application that brings complete confidentiality to board voting.

Traditional blockchain governance exposes individual votes. Our solution uses fully homomorphic encryption to keep votes completely private while maintaining verifiable results.

Board members create resolutions with custom quorum requirements, cast encrypted votes that remain private throughout the process, and only final results are revealed when voting concludes.

Built with FHEVM's TFHE library, votes are encrypted as euint32 types, computed homomorphically on-chain, and only decrypted through Zama's secure gateway for final tallies.

Perfect for corporate boards, shareholder votes, and confidential committee decisions where privacy and transparency must coexist.

Experience confidential governance today at our live demo, explore the open-source code on GitHub, and build the future of private blockchain applications with FHEVM.
