# Privacy-Preserving Corporate Governance - Video Script (60 seconds)

## Scene 1: Introduction (0-10 seconds)
**Visual**: Animated title card with corporate governance theme, transitioning to FHEVM logo

**Action**:
- Show animated logo of corporate board meeting
- Display "Privacy-Preserving Corporate Governance" title
- Transition to FHEVM encryption visualization

**Dialogue**: "Welcome to Privacy-Preserving Corporate Governance, a breakthrough FHEVM application that brings complete confidentiality to board voting."

## Scene 2: Problem Statement (10-18 seconds)
**Visual**: Split screen showing traditional transparent voting vs private voting needs

**Action**:
- Left side: Show transparent blockchain with visible votes (crossed out in red)
- Right side: Show encrypted votes with lock icons (green checkmarks)
- Animate comparison highlighting privacy concerns

**Dialogue**: "Traditional blockchain governance exposes individual votes. Our solution uses fully homomorphic encryption to keep votes completely private while maintaining verifiable results."

## Scene 3: Key Features Demo (18-35 seconds)
**Visual**: Live application walkthrough showing main interface

**Action**:
- Show web interface at corporate-governance.vercel.app
- Demonstrate board member connecting wallet
- Display resolution creation form with title and quorum
- Show voting interface with yes/no options
- Highlight encryption indicator during vote submission
- Display encrypted vote confirmation

**Dialogue**: "Board members create resolutions with custom quorum requirements, cast encrypted votes that remain private throughout the process, and only final results are revealed when voting concludes."

## Scene 4: Technical Highlights (35-48 seconds)
**Visual**: Code snippets and architecture diagram

**Action**:
- Display Solidity code snippet showing TFHE.add and TFHE.select operations
- Animate encrypted data flow: user input → encryption → smart contract → homomorphic computation
- Show euint32 types for vote tallies
- Highlight Gateway.requestDecryption for result revelation
- Display access control modifiers

**Dialogue**: "Built with FHEVM's TFHE library, votes are encrypted as euint32 types, computed homomorphically on-chain, and only decrypted through Zama's secure gateway for final tallies."

## Scene 5: Use Cases & Benefits (48-55 seconds)
**Visual**: Icon grid showing various use cases

**Action**:
- Display rotating icons representing:
  - Corporate board decisions
  - Executive compensation votes
  - Merger approvals
  - Committee decisions
- Show checkmarks appearing next to key benefits:
  - Complete vote privacy
  - Transparent results
  - Regulatory compliance
  - Audit trail

**Dialogue**: "Perfect for corporate boards, shareholder votes, and confidential committee decisions where privacy and transparency must coexist."

## Scene 6: Call to Action (55-60 seconds)
**Visual**: Final screen with links and repository information

**Action**:
- Show live demo link: corporate-governance.vercel.app
- Display GitHub repository link
- Show Sepolia contract address with Etherscan verification badge
- Animate Zama logo and "Built with FHEVM" badge
- End card with social links

**Dialogue**: "Experience confidential governance today at our live demo, explore the open-source code on GitHub, and build the future of private blockchain applications with FHEVM."

## Technical Specifications

**Duration**: 60 seconds total
**Format**: 1920x1080 (Full HD)
**Frame Rate**: 30 fps
**Audio**: Voice-over with background music (subtle, professional)
**Transitions**: Smooth fades and slides (0.5-1 second each)

## Visual Elements Required

1. **Title Cards**: Corporate governance branding, FHEVM logo
2. **Screen Recordings**: Live web application demo
3. **Code Snippets**: Solidity smart contract highlights
4. **Diagrams**: Encryption flow, architecture overview
5. **Icons**: Use case illustrations, feature checkmarks
6. **End Card**: Links, QR codes, call-to-action

## Animation Guidelines

- **Pace**: Fast but clear, matching 60-second constraint
- **Highlighting**: Use colored boxes or arrows for important code
- **Transitions**: Professional crossfades, no jarring cuts
- **Text**: Large, readable fonts (minimum 24pt for code)
- **Colors**: Professional palette (blues, grays, greens for success)

## Key Messages to Emphasize

1. **Privacy First**: Individual votes never revealed
2. **FHEVM Powered**: Built on cutting-edge homomorphic encryption
3. **Production Ready**: Live demo on Sepolia testnet
4. **Open Source**: Full code available for learning and contribution
5. **Real-world Utility**: Solves actual corporate governance privacy needs

## Post-Production Notes

- Add subtle zoom effects on code snippets for emphasis
- Include encryption visualization (lock icons, encrypted data streams)
- Use progress indicator for scene transitions
- Add captions/subtitles for accessibility
- Include background music at -20dB to -18dB (not overpowering voice)
